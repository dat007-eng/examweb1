         My role in this project is front end developer, UX designer and document manager. I am good at HTML and CSS because I have already done some successful projects with them. I also have a little knowledge of PHP and MySQL since I learnt from the previous course. However, I am not as good as my other teammates because they have done more projects than me. Nevertheless, I am a listener and responsible person, I will be able to work together with my teammate to make a successful project.</p>
